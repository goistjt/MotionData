# MotionData
By Brooke Brown, Jeremiah Goist, Steve Trotta and Runzhi Yang
## Project Description:
NSWC Crane has a six-degrees-of-freedom motion platform used for simulating vehicle feedback for various situations and vehicles. The current simulation of data relies of sinusoidal models of acceleration for each axis; however, these models do not accurately reflect real world gyroscopic and accelerometer data. To solve this problem, we aim to create a system which can first collect various sample data sets, and eventually derive a more accurate model which can be used to generate new motion data for use in simulations.
##Milestone1:
  1.	Progress on problem statement
  2.	Progress on class diagram/method for documenting design
  3.	Progress on project plan
  4.	Setup any and all tools/VMâ€™s that are needed for the project
  5.	Identify testing strategy
  6.	Create mock up of the webpage
  7.	Research on the data collection
  	
##Milestone2:
  1.	First version of problem statement
  2.	First version of design
  3.	First version of project plan
  4.	First sprint backlog including identification of features for first sprint
  
##Milestone3:
  1.	Commence weekly sprints
  2.	Deliverables include all artifacts identified below under weekly sprints
