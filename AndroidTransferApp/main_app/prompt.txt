Transfer Application Interface Started!
***Please note that every space character used in these commands is considered a parameter delimiter, or the differentiation character between inputs of methods.***
Steps:
1. Plug the Android device you wish to transfer from, via usb, into your computer.
2. To 'update' the Android cache by transferring the files from the phone to the computer, type one of these commands:
   To change transfer file repository location (on record) and transfer files:
        update -r <new location>
   To change adb location (on record) and transfer files:
        update -a <new location>
   To change both locations (on record) and transfer files:
        update <new ADB location> <new FILE REPO location>
   To keep what is on record and transfer based on the previous inputs:
        update
3. To 'clear' the Android cache by deleting all files stored in the designated transfer directory, type this command:
   clear
   [the clear command has no parameters, but will attempt to clear regardless ignoring the 'parameters' given]
   [the location this command will clear is the last file repository location used with the update command]
   [WARNING: this command will clear ALL FILES, regardless of type, in the FILE REPOSITORY location specified in the last update
   DO NOT USE if there are files you wish not to delete in the FILE REPOSITORY location we have specified]
4. To exit the application, type this command:
   quit
